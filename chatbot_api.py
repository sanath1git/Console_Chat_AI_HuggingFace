# We are importing the requests library to send HTTP requests to Hugging Face's API.
# It helps us communicate with the cloud model just like a browser or app does.
# Falcon-7B-Instruct mode
# The headers variable is a dictionary in Python. (key-value pairs)
# Bearer is a keyword that tells the server you're using token-based authentication.
# It sends the prompt as a JSON payload to the API using POST.
# 200 is the HTTP status code that means "OK" or "Success"
# This takes the raw JSON reply from the API and converts it into a Python object (usually a list or dictionary).
# Weâ€™re accessing the first item in the list
